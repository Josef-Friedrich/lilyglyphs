% New Image Glyphs for the lilyglyphs package
% created by buildglyphimages.py on 2012-11-08

% This file contains definitions for the new commands
% along with test code for them.
% You can test the commands in the context of continuous text
% and adjust their design time options.
% Afterwards you should manually move the commands to
% the appropriate .inp files,
% because this file will be overwritten by the next run
% of buildglyphimages.py!
% If you want to keep this file for reference
% you should save it with a new name.
%
% There also is a table containing entries for use in the lilyglyph manual.
% You can either copy the whole table to the appropriate
% place in lilyglyphs.tex or just copy individual table rows.
