% this file is to stash away the first experiments with pgfkeys.
% I achieved what I wanted with keyval instead,
% but we might return to pgfkeys later

\newcommand\testpgf[2][]{%
	\pgfkeys{/lilyglpyh, #1}
	{{\fontspec[Scale=\lilyglyphScale]{Emmentaler-11} \XeTeXglyph\XeTeXglyphindex"#2" }}

% begin document

\section*{pgfkeys}
%\pgfkeys{/Scale/.code 2 args={{{\fontspec[Scale=#1]{Emmentaler-16}{#2}}}}}
%\pgfkeys{/Scale={2}{f}}

\testkeyval[scale=2]{f}\testkeyval[raise=1]{f}

\testkeyval[scale=2]{fzm1}\testkeyval[scale=2,raise=0.4]{fzm1}

Hm, where does the hspace between the expressions come from? Test with the old lilyText:

\raisebox{0.5ex}{\lilyText[1.5]{fzm1}}\raisebox{0.5ex}{\lilyText[1.5]{fzm1}}
