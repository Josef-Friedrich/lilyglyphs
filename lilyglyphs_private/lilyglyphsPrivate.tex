\section*{\lilyglyphs{} Private Additions Reference}
Please use this document to document your new commands.
If you have generated them with the Python scripts you will already have a working \cmd{reftable} to copy\,\&\,paste, otherwise please add one according to the following example:

\begin{reftable}{Example Command}{examplecommand}
\lilyExampleCommand & \cmd{lilyExampleCommand} & Example command from \texttt{lilyglyphsPrivate.sty}\\
\end{reftable}

If you add a command to the context of an existing reftable, please add a comment to simplify our life when processing your contribution.
If the command(s) need any specific considerations please also add them to the documentation.
