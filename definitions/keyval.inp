% Family lilyDesignOptions
%
% This family is used for defining default values for the options at design time
% i.e. when developping predefined commands.

% Family lilyGlobalOptions
%
% This family is used for globally adjusting the option values.
% The user can globally override options at any time
% using the command \lilyOptions.
% This is originally intended for cases where the package defaults
% are not very suitable for the font of the continuous text
\define@key{lilyGlobalOptions}{scale}{\def\lilyGlobalOptions@scale{#1}}

% Initialize these \defs to 'no adjustment' because the user doesn't have to do that
\def\lilyGlobalOptions@scale{1}
\def\lilyGlobalOptions@raise{0}

% Change any of the global options at any place in the document
% (only options that are present are affected)
\newcommand*{\lilyGlobalOptions}[1]{\setkeys{lilyGlobalOptions}{#1}}

% Family lilyCmdOptions
%
% This family is used for options the end user can use to fine tune the output
% (i.e. within the actual document)
\define@key{lilyCmdOptions}{scale}{\def\lilyCmdOptions@scale{#1}}
\define@key{lilyCmdOptions}{raise}{\def\lilyCmdOptions@raise{#1}}

% Calculate the effective option values from 
% - global defaults,
% - design time defaults and
% - actual user options
%
% Scaling factors are multiplied.
% Raise levels are summed.

	% in order to avoid uninitialized arguments

	\setkeys{lilyCmdOptions}{#1}%
	% calculate the scaling factor 
	\pgfmathsetmacro{\lilyEffectiveScale}{%
