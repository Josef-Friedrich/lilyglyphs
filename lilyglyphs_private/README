This folder is a 'shadow' copy of the
/glyphimages directory structure.
It is meant for extending the package and should be
placed somewhere in your local texmf tree.

In addition to the main directory this shadow contains
a folder 'custom_images'.
You can use this to create image driven commands with
images not obtained through the use of our scripts.
