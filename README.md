lilyglyphs (Xe)LaTeX package
============================

Package to make LilyPond's notational elements and glyphs from its Emmentaler OpenType Font available in (Xe)LaTeX

Intended use
------------

Insert single or combined glyphs such as notes, dynamics etc. in LaTeX documents.  
This is **not** a replacement to lilypond-book.

In order to use this package one has to
  - use a LaTeX flavor that can use the fontspec package and
  - make the Emmentaler OTF available to fontspec.
  - make sure the pdf files used for image driven commands are present

Please also see INSTALL.md

For more info see the manual on the download page.

There are discussions about also support plain LaTeX.  
Any assistance in this field is highly appreciated.
