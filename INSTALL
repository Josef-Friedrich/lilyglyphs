INSTALL for 'lilyglyphs'

'lilyglyphs' is a package to make musical symbols and
notational elements of the LilyPond engraving software
(http://www.lilypond.org) available to LaTeX documents.

There are several ways to obtain the package, with different
installation procedures.

If you have obtained the package through a TeX distribution
you should be able to use the package without further action.
For advanced options and usage please refer to the manual.

If you have downloaded lilyglyphs.zip from CTAN please extract the 
archive to a location in your texmf tree, 
e.g. ~/texmf/tex/latex/lilyglyphs. 

If you have downloaded lilyglyphs.tds.zip from CTAN please extract
the archive to the root of your texmf tree, e.g. ~/texmf.

If you want to use the Github repository you should clone it
(or your fork) to a directory in your local texmf tree, e.g.
~/texmf/tex/latex/lilyglyphs. 

Each of the above options should allow you to immediately use 
the package. Please note that the Git repository doesn't contain
a precompiled manual.

If you want to compile the manual with LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX you need 
the (free) fonts 'Linux Libertine O', 'Linux Biolinum O' and 'DejaVu 
Sans Mono'. If you don't want or can't install them you can modify
'documentation/lilyglyphsManualFonts.sty' to use different fonts
or remove the reference to it from 'documentation/lilyglyphs.tex'
to use default fonts.
