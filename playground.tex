\section*{Fix trailing space}
Trailing space? \lilyDynamics{ff} here

Call by glyph: \lilyGlyph{accidentals.flat} here\
\flat* text \flat text




\section*{Numbers}
Numbers with scaling 1 suit like this: \lilyText{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9} in a line.\\
If you want them like uppercase letters you should try a scaling of \lilyText[scale=1.3]{0 + 1 4 7} 1.3 instead.

\section*{Time Signatures}
	This is a normal Time signature: \lilyTimeSignature[scale=4]{3}{4}.
	
	As the plus sign is also directly accessible you can write 
	\lilyTimeSignature{1\,+\,7}{8} or even	
	\lilyTimeSignature{1 + 7}{8 + 4} easily :-)
	
	One more option: \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8}\lilyText{+}\lilyTimeSignature{7}{4}. 

	It respects the \texttt{raise} option, but that makes no sense: \lilyTimeSignature[raise=1]{4}{8}.
	
	Also it doesn't really work with \texttt{scale} values smaller than 1:
	\lilyTimeSignature[scale=.5]{3}{4}.
