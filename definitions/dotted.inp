% where
% #1: scaling factor x
% #2: curve factor n
% #4 line steepness m
% #3 offset o (offset of 0 results in a dotSpace of 0 at scale=1).
% The result is supposed to be taken as ex and stored in \lilyDotSpaceF
% which is used by \lilyDotSpace

% Interpret the different options to be used for printing a dot
% The optional arguments (passed as #1)given by the user are taken into account,
% then the scaling and raise are calculated using the design options 
% from the calling predefined command.
% Finally the space between the glyph and the dot is calculated using the
% 2nd order function \lilyCalcDotSpace:
% (1/n * scale^2) - 1/n + (1/m * scale) - 1/m + o
% #2: curve factor n
% #4 line steepness m
% #3 offset o (offset of 0 results in a dotSpace of 0 at scale=1).
