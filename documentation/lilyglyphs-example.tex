\lilyglyphs{} makes the notational elements of LilyPond%
\footnote{\url{http://www.lilypond.org}}
available to \LaTeX{} documents.
This can be accidentals like \flat{} or \sharp, but also articulation scripts like \hspace{.1ex} \fermata, notes like \crotchet{} or time signatures like \lilyTimeCHalf{} or \lilyTimeSignature{5}{8}.
This will be an important tool if you author documents about music, be it a critical report or an analytical essay.\\
Now it's easy to write: 
\begin{quote}
In m.\,24 the \decrescHairpin{} lasts from the 2\superscript{nd} \halfNote{} to the \lilyDynamics{sf} on the 11\superscript{th} \semiquaverDown[raise=-.5].
\end{quote}
One thing that sets \lilyglyphs{} apart from other solutions I had investigated is that it effectively can print \emph{anything} that can be done with LilyPond. 
Not only accesses it the OpenType music font provided by LilyPond, but it also allows one to use small \textsc{pdf} images that are generated by LilyPond, thus enabling the use of arbitrarily complicated constructs.
Take this \cmd{fancyExample} \fancyExample{} as an example.
There is a (growing) set of predefined commands available while anything else can be used using generic access commands.

\small
The other nice thing is that the glyphs \halfNoteRest{} scale well with the surrounding font size, 
\large making it easy \halfNoteRest{} to incorporate them into continuous text.
\normalsize By default the glyphs scale automatically but they can also be scaled \clefG[scale=.4] manually, individually or for the whole document \clefG[scale=1.8,raise=-4].

\medskip
\lilyglyphs{} can easily be extended by writing custom predefined commands.
With the help of a few enclosed helper programs it is even easy to create new commands based on notation generated with LilyPond.
If you do so please report back to us and help increasing the glyph coverage of the package.
