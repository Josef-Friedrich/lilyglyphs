'lilyglyphs' LaTeX package
==========================

Package to make LilyPond's notational elements available in LaTeX

This package is part of the **openLilyLib** family of resources for LaTeX and LilyPond  
([www.openlilylib.org](http://www.openlilylib.org)), its project homepage is http://www.openlilylib.org/lilyglyphs.

------------

Intended use
------------

Insert single or combined glyphs such as notes, dynamics etc. in LaTeX documents.  
This is **not** intended for including music examples, for which you should
refer to `lilypond-book` and/or `musicexamples`.

As `lilyglyphs` relies on `fontspec` to access the glyphs of LilyPond's 'Emmentaler' font the package can only be used with LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX.

For more info see also the file `README` and the manual

- on the [project website](http://www.openlilylib.org/lilyglyphs)
- in the LaTeX sources in `/documentation`
