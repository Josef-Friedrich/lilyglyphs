\section*{Dynamic Letters}
	\lilyText{sffpzm1+2}
{	\LARGE
	\lilyText[1.4]{sffpzm1+2 - , .}
}	
	
	lilyText \lilyText{sf} and lilyDynamics \lilyDynamics{sf} with default scaling.
	
	Compare sf with and without small space between:\\
	\lilyDynamics{rfz}\\
	\lilyDynamics{r\hspace{0.035ex}fz}\\
	\lilyRF* more text\\
	\lilyRFZ.
	
\section*{Numbers}
Numbers with scaling 1 suit like this: \lilyText{0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9} in a line.\\
If you want them like uppercase letters you should try a scaling of \lilyText[1.3]{0 + 1 4 7} 1.3 instead.

\section*{Time Signatures}
	This is a normal Time signature: \lilyTimeSignature{3}{4}.
	
	As the plus sign is also directly accessible you can even
	write \lilyTimeSignature{3+7}{8+4} easily :-)
	
	One more option: \lilyTimeSignature{3}{8} \lilyText{+} \lilyTimeSignature{7}{4} (note the space that the formula environment makes around it. Maybe this isn't the best approach?

	%Test the space after \lilyText
	This is a dynamics \lilyText[1.4]{s} line. Space is added.\\
	Two letters in one command: \lilyText[1.4]{sf}\\
	Space between dynamics and fullstop? \lilyText[1.4]{s}.\\
	OK: \textbackslash lilyText doesn't create space afterwards but allows one without having to provide \{\}
