INSTALL for 'lilyglyphs'

'lilyglyphs' is a package to make musical symbols and
notational elements of the LilyPond engraving software
(http://www.lilypond.org) available to LaTeX documents.

If you haven't obtained the package through a LaTeX distribution
you should save/extract the complete directory somewhere in your
LaTeX search tree, e.g. in ~/texmf/tex/latex/lilyglyphs.
There should be no further dependencies to use it.

If you want to compile the manual with LuaLaTeX or XeLaTeX you need 
the (free) fonts 'Linux Libertine O', 'Linux Biolinum O' and 'DejaVu 
Sans Mono'. If you don't want or can't install them you can modify
'documentation/lilyglyphsManualFonts.sty' to use different fonts
or remove the reference to it from 'documentation/lilyglyphs.tex'
to use default fonts.
