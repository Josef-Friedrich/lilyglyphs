%\newcommand{\lilyNumber}[2][1.35]{\lilyText[#1]{#2}}

% general \time n/m command (prints time signature as a fraction in emmentaler font)
\newcommand*{\lilyTimeSignature}[2]{$\frac{\mbox{\lilyText{#1}}}{\mbox{\lilyText{#2}}}$}

\begin{document}
	\lilyText{sffpzm1+2}
	
	This is a normal Time signature: \lilyTimeSignature{3}{4}.
	
	As the plus sign is also directly accessible you can even
	write \lilyTimeSignature{3+7}{8+4} easily :-)

	%\lilyNumber
